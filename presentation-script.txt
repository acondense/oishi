Hi we are Ariel and Daryll
We are presenting our project Oishi: A Speaker Diarization which focuses in handling the overlapping parts in a speech conversation
So, what is Speaker Diarization. Speaker Diarization is the process of determine of who spoke when and what.
One of the problems in Speaker Diarization is the presence of oveerlapping speakers which causes some error in the diarization process
Our project aims to address this issue by utilizing RMS Energy for the Detection of Overlap and CNSC for labelling these overlaps
So our system accepts an input of audio recording in .wav format
We strict the number of speakers into 3. <Improve the reasoning here> Because an overlap in an audio recording with only two speakers will automatically identify who are the two speakers. An audio recording with 4 or more speakers that overlaps will be more of a challenge for the entire diarization process. So 3 is the minimum no of speakers to identify the effectives on CNSC in labelling the overlapping speeches.

After the audio files is diarize a summary of the conversation will be displayed

In the evaluation tab, we can evaluate if a given speech segment (both voiced and unvoiced) is one of the Diarization Errors
False Alarm, Missed Speech, Speaker Error. Timestamps are shown for each segment which the evaluators will counter check againts the audio recording.

In evaluating the effectiveness of RMS in detecting overlaps, the evaluator can check if the detected overlapping is really an overlap

Evaluation of CNSC will fall under the Speaker Error in the DER, our tool only allows two overlapping speakers at time in a three speaker audio recording.
